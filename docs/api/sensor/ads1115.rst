ADS1115 ADC Component
=====================

.. warning:: This sensor is experimental has not been tested yet. If you can verify it works, notify me on discord.

.. cpp:namespace:: esphomelib::input

This class allows using ADS1115 Analog to Digital converters (`datasheet`_, `adafruit`_) devices with esphomelib.
Doing so requires some steps:

.. _datasheet: http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ads1115.pdf
.. _adafruit: https://www.adafruit.com/product/1085

.. cpp:namespace:: esphomelib::sensor::ADS1115Component

1. Initialize the i2c bus with the pins you have SDA and SCL connected to:

    .. code-block:: cpp

        // inside setup()
        App.init_i2c(SDA_PIN, SCL_PIN);

2. Create the "hub" or the ADS1115 device itself. The parameter you pass in here is the i2c
    address of the ADS1115. See :cpp:func:`set_address` for possible other addresses.

    .. code-block:: cpp

        // after init_i2c
        auto *ads1115 = App.make_ads1115_component(0x48);

    This will create an ADS1115 component which you can now use to create individual sensors.

3. Create the sensors, you can have multiple of these. Do so by calling :cpp:func:`get_sensor` with
    the multiplexer channel you want (essentially between which pins you want to measure voltage) and
    the gain for that sensor and register that sensor to MQTT.

    .. code-block:: cpp

        auto *sensor = ads1115->get_sensor(ADS1115_MUX_P0_N1, ADS1115_PGA_6P144);
        App.make_mqtt_sensor_for(sensor, "ADS1115 Voltage #1");

.. cpp:namespace:: esphomelib

See :cpp:func:`Application::make_ads1115_component`.
